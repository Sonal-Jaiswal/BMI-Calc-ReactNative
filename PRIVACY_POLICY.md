This Privacy Policy describes how BMI Calculator ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Do Not Collect

## How We Use Your Information

The information you provide is used solely for the purpose of calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI) within the app. This data is processed ephemerally, meaning it is only held in memory while you are using the app and is discarded when the app is closed. We do not have access to this information.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any of your data with third parties. Since we do not collect any data, there is nothing to share.
